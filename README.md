# Sentiment-Mining

The motivation is to do text categorization using classical Machine Learning algorithms.
The goal is to build a sentiment categorization system for tweets.
The input of the code will be a set of tweets and the output will be a prediction for each tweet positive or negative.

The classifier that predicts for a given new tweet (which does have a positive or a negative sentiment) its sentiment polarity.
To accomplish this, na√Øve Bayes and logistic regression is used for basline. 
To improve system performance over the baseline SVM, Multigrams are also used.
